## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile Methodology
Description: Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development that focuses on collaboration, customer feedback, and small, rapid releases.

Advantages:

Flexibility: Agile allows for changes and adjustments throughout the project lifecycle based on feedback and evolving requirements.

Customer Collaboration: Frequent interactions with customers ensure that the final product aligns with their needs and expectations.

Faster Delivery: Iterative releases mean that features and functionalities are delivered incrementally, allowing for quicker deployment and early delivery of valuable components.

Improved Quality: Continuous testing and feedback loops help identify and fix issues early in the development process.

Team Empowerment: Agile encourages self-organizing teams and promotes collaboration, leading to higher team morale and productivity.

Disadvantages:

Scope Creep: Continuous changes and evolving requirements can lead to scope creep, potentially causing delays and budget overruns.

Less Predictability: The iterative nature of Agile makes it challenging to predict the final timeline and costs upfront.

Requires Discipline: Agile requires a high level of discipline and commitment from the entire team to be effective.

Initial Learning Curve: Teams new to Agile may face an initial learning curve and require training and adaptation time.

Waterfall Methodology
Description: Waterfall is a linear and sequential approach to project management and software development, where each phase must be completed before moving on to the next.

Advantages:

Clear Structure: Waterfall's linear approach provides a clear structure and defined stages, making it easy to understand and manage.

Predictable Outcomes: Detailed planning and documentation upfront make it easier to predict timelines, costs, and project outcomes.

Easy to Manage: The defined phases and milestones make it easier for project managers to track progress and manage the project.

Good for Fixed-Price Projects: Waterfall is well-suited for projects with fixed-price contracts where requirements are unlikely to change.

Disadvantages:

Inflexibility: Waterfall is rigid and does not accommodate changes easily once a phase is completed.

Late Testing: Testing is done at the end of the development cycle, making it difficult to identify and fix issues early.

Customer Involvement: Limited customer involvement after the initial requirements phase can lead to a final product that may not fully meet customer needs.

Longer Delivery Time: The sequential nature of Waterfall means that the final product is delivered only after all phases are completed, which can result in longer delivery times.
